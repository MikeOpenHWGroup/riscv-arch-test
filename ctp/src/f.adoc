=== Floating-Point Extensions

Supporting floating-point involves enabling at least the F extension.  Other extensions depend on F.  The coverpoints are specified in the following sections. Some tests only apply when multiple extensions are supported.

==== F Single-Precision FP

==== D Double-Precision FP

[[t-D-coverpoints]]
.D Instruction Coverpoints

==== Zfh Half-Precision FP

[[t-Zfh-coverpoints]]
.Zfh Instruction Coverpoints

===== ZfhD

[[t-ZfhD-coverpoints]]
.ZfhD Instruction Coverpoints
include::{testplansdir}/ZfhD.adoc[]


===== Zfhmin

[[t-Zfhmin-coverpoints]]
.Zfhmin Instruction Coverpoints
include::{testplansdir}/Zfhmin.adoc[]


===== ZfhminD

[[t-ZfhminD-coverpoints]]
.ZfhminD Instruction Coverpoints
include::{testplansdir}/ZfhminD.adoc[]

==== Zfa Additional FP

Tests for Zfa for single-precision floating-point are called ZfaF.

[[t-ZfaF-coverpoints]]
.ZfaF Instruction Coverpoints
include::{testplansdir}/ZfaF.adoc[]

===== ZfaD

[[t-ZfaD-coverpoints]]
.ZfaD Instruction Coverpoints
include::{testplansdir}/ZfaD.adoc[]


===== ZfaZfh

[[t-ZfaZfh-coverpoints]]
.ZfaZfh Instruction Coverpoints
include::{testplansdir}/ZfaZfh.adoc[]

===== ZfaZfhD

When Zfa is supported with both Zfh and D, there are additional
NAN-Boxing tests for 16-bit values in 64-bit registers.

.ZfaZfhD Instruction Coverpoints

===== Zfbfmin Scalar BF16 Converts
