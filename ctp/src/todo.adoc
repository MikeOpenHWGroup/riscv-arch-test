== To Do

I think we might want to rethink some of our privileged testing structure and switch to having Sm, S, and U testplans/coverpoints/tests instead of lumping most of that into ZicsrM/S/U. I will also be more apparent what is being tested where that way.

=== Current Status

At present, coverpoints and tests are being developed in the https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw-arch-verif/[cvw-arch-verif] repository and being tested on the https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw[CORE-V Wally] processor.  The goal is to be able to certify RVA23S64 as well as spec-compliant machine mode.

This test plan exists in the form of spreadsheets, and is being converted to ASCII Doc.

As of July 2025, all unprivileged and privileged RVA23S64 features have tests hitting 100% of the coverpoints, with the following exceptions:

* The Vector tests found some bugs in Sail, which are being fixed
* Interrupt tests coverpoints complete, tests partially complete
* PMP tests in progress
* Virtual memory: Sv39 and Sv48 100% coverage, Sv48 debugging one coverpoint
* Hypervisor not started
* Other minor new extensions not started
