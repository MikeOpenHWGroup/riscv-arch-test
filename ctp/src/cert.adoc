== Certification Process

Certifying a RISC-V Device-Under-Test (DUT) involves the following steps:

* Selecting a profile for the DUT
* Providing a Unified Database (UDB) configuration for the DUT, such as optional extensions, peripheral addresses, and PMP granularity
* Generating self-checking tests based on the selected profile and UDB
* Running the tests and reporting pass/fail

Test developers also need to

* Generate a coverage report confirming that the tests hit all the coverpoints based on a Sail trace
